The document outlines a data science project by Defne Kizilkaya, focusing on how seasonal changes affect reading habits. 


Key components of the project include:

* Motivation: Investigating the influence of seasons on reading preferences, like genre and book length, hypothesizing that seasonal changes significantly influence my reading habits, with a measurable difference in the quantity of books read.

* Data Source/Data Collection: Utilizing data from Goodreads, where books read since 2016 were tracked.

* Data Analysis: Techniques involve importing and cleaning data using pandas, then performing various analyses, including:
    * Exploratory Data Analysis: Assessing basic dataset characteristics.
    * Author Analysis: Identifying most-read authors by season.
    * Yearly and Monthly Reading Habits: Analyzing reading trends over time.
    * Seasonal Analysis: Examining reading patterns per season.
    * Statistical Testing: Conducting ANOVA tests to identify significant seasonal differences.

* Visualization: Creating bar charts, line charts, stacked bar charts, and box plots for visual representation of data.

* Machine Learning: Using linear regression models to predict future reading habits and analyzing model performance.

* Findings: Confirming that reading habits are influenced by seasons and external factors like the pandemic and exams.

* Limitations and Future Work: Acknowledging the need for a broader dataset and plans to incorporate more detailed aspects such as genres and author styles for deeper analysis.

The project combines statistical and machine learning methods to explore and predict personal reading trends influenced by seasonal changes.
